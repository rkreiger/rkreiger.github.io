    			     <p> When you live in Dillsburg although there is stuff you can do it gets a little boring... so go and hang out with friends and family. We have a brusters ice cream, a railroad track with a creek, and so much more. Farmer's Fair is a festival we have annually around mid-october. We have games, food, tractors, and two very loud and fun parades. Whenever we're not doing that you can find us judging the cutest baby of the year or finding out which artist has painted the best mural or mug of the Farmer's Fair spirit.</p>
