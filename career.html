    			     <p> Hello...Again, In my future my plan is to become a programmmer at a high end buisness. My plan is to go to school for 4 years to get my masters in programming. The median wage for a programmer is $84,280 according to <a href ="https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/mobile/computer-programmers.htm"</a>Google< The only reason I have planned to do so is because if my Uncle. He is a programmer for a very well known company that i will keep confidential for security risks. I have had many ideas over the years from farmer, computer networker, and actuary, all of these jobs a very good pay and are in dire need to be supplied. These jobs are in the stem field which is in the highest demand right now. </p>
